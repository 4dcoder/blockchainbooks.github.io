Hundreds of blogs, videos, and books claim to explain Bitcoin. Some of them work well, but only if you belong to the right audience. Many works throw non-experts into the deep end without a life vest. Others skip along the surface leaving non-beginners little of value for their time. The result is unsatisfying at best and dangerous at worst. Without the knowledge and confidence to manage your own money, you may entrust it to others - the very situation Bitcoin was created to overturn. All the while, these services gobble up financial secrets for unknown ends. Even if you have no bitcoin, ignorance of Bitcoin's technical underpinnings makes it hard to follow new developments and spot opportunities.
